# Hostel-Arrays-
Introductory exercises in object-oriented programming with Arrays in Java.

The owner of a boarding house has ten rooms to rent out to students,
these rooms are identified by the numbers 0 to 9.
Make a program that starts with all ten rooms empty, and then
read a number N representing the number of students who are going to
rent rooms (N can be from 1 to 10). Then record the rent of
N students. For each rental record, enter the student's name and email address, as well as the
email address, as well as which of the rooms they chose (from 0 to 9). Suppose
a vacant room is chosen. At the end, your program should print
a report of all occupancies in the hostel, in room order,
as in the example.
